Presented a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of the NDC80 gene, emphasizing its role as an immunological and prognostic marker. Covered differential expression of NDC80 in normal tissue, primary tumors, and metastases, and its correlation with patient survival outcomes, immune cell infiltration, and resistance to cancer therapies. This work was awarded **1st place** as the Best Graduation Project by the Faculty of Science.
