Welcome, Traveler!  
======
I’m **Farag Mamdouh Farag Ibrahim**, a bioinformatician and data science researcher currently based in Cairo, Egypt.  

I started my scientific journey in biotechnology, diving into the complexities of molecular biology. But somewhere along the way, I discovered computational biology and bioinformatics—and I’ve never looked back. Analyzing data, writing code, and solving puzzles felt not only safer but way more exciting.  

That said, I’m not exactly the most graceful person in the room. My friends often joke that I should have my own lab safety training manual. I once managed to trip on a completely flat surface, and someone nearby said, *"Farag, how have you survived this long?"* Honestly, it’s a fair question!  

These days, my work revolves around building computational tools to explore how cells organize into tissues and how we can apply that knowledge to improve our understanding of diseases. Whether it’s working with spatial transcriptomics or single-cell genomics, I enjoy digging deep into the data to uncover hidden insights.  

Inspiration often strikes from the pages of science fiction. Stories about futuristic technology and life beyond Earth have shaped my perspective on what’s possible. Virtual cells, synthetic biology, AI-driven medicine—it all feels like stepping into the future. Thank you, Kim Stanley Robinson, for sparking that imagination!

Research Interests  
======
I’m passionate about:  
- **Spatial Biology**: Unraveling how cells interact within tissues.  
- **Gene Regulation**: Understanding how genes are switched on and off.  
- **Cell Organization**: Exploring how cells form functional systems.  
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Applying algorithms to biological data.  
- **Synthetic Biology and Cell Engineering**: Designing cells with specific purposes.  

I also have a soft spot for topics like:  
- Plant biology and its role in sustainability.  
- Solar punk urbanism: imagining greener, more equitable futures.  
- In situ resource utilization: making the most of local resources, whether on Earth or in space.  
- Interplanetary settlements: thinking about life on other planets.
