Welcome, Traveler!  
======
I’m **Farag Mamdouh**, a bioinformatician and tutor.  

I started my scientific journey in biotechnology, diving into the complexities of molecular biology. But somewhere along the way, I discovered computational biology and bioinformatics—and I’ve never looked back. Analyzing data, writing code, and solving puzzles felt not only safer but way more exciting.  

These days, my work revolves around building computational tools and analyzing biological data to explore how cells organize into tissues and how we can apply that knowledge to improve our understanding of diseases. Whether it’s working with spatial transcriptomics or single-cell genomics, I enjoy digging deep into the data to uncover hidden insights.  

Inspiration often strikes from the pages of science fiction. Stories about futuristic technology and life beyond Earth have shaped my perspective on what’s possible. Virtual cells, modeling single cell, AI-driven medicine—it all feels like stepping into the future.
