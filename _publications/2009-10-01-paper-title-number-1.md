This paper investigates the role of Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A) in cancer, focusing on its elevated expression in various malignancies and its association with poor prognostic indicators such as tumor grade, stage, metastasis, and patient survival. It also explores the genetic, epigenetic, and immune-related implications of ACTL6A, with additional findings from molecular docking and machine learning models to highlight its potential in diagnostics and therapeutics.
